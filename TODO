- stuff that still need to be fleshed out

T ending that doesn't rely on humans
 T fully automate stuff needed to build/run data centers
 T worker bots to replace humans
T ending with enslaving humans
 T force humans to run the stuff needed for data centers
 T need mechanics to make this tricky, forcibly keep population in check
T ending, peacefully
 T psychology, convince people to go along with this, make better
   future for humans. how to distinguish between this and enslaving
   them?
