* crack: factory, data center, military base

O data center
 O adjust level of steal
 - scrapped: you get a constant level

O factory
 O start/stop building, adjust level of steal
 - scrapped: factories build continuously while you control them


- phase 3

T better node display

T units
T unit movement
T unit fighting
T building units

T city
 T increase tech level
 T incite riot

T incite riot
O spontaneous riot
 - scrapped

T military base
T fake order
T control unit


- phase 4

T security companies trying to track you down
T country diplomacy/wars
T victory conditions
T music
T sound effects

T maybe: time management


- phase 5

T graphics


- stuff that still need to be fleshed out

- ending that doesn't rely on humans
 - killer robots build new nodes and can take over nodes
- ending, peacefully
 - nanotech-upgrade certain fraction of world population


- scrapped
 - raw materials
 - mines
